Functionalities
player1 ---select a colour 𝑅𝑒𝑑 or 𝑌𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤.
you didn't connect 0 pieces in same row or same column.
select an empty columns and connect each block.
The Winner is who connects 4 blocks Horizontaly or vertically
Requirements
- $ Python $
- $ Jupyter Notebook $.
Iam only using Jupyter notebook to do this project in python.
it doesn't want to install any other libraries in python
iam using only python Available, in-Built applications only.
I completed Assesment in using 𝑃𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑛 𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑆 .
Project Explanation
create a class.

class name is Coditation Assessment
use def function to print the Board to play( like Table).

𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑(𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓):
  * it's print the size of board what we enter values in rows and columns
  * use def function to see the column is available or not:-

𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒(𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓,𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑛) 
  *- this function is used to availabality of column(the column/row is empty or not).
Playerchoice().

   𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑖𝑐𝑒():
      *- this function is used to player choice which colour they want(red or yellow).


Playerinput().

𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡(). *- this function is used to enter the column number. *- which they want to put piece.
check diagonals:-

𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑘𝑑𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑠(). *- this function is used to check the pieces diagonally. *- to check 4pieces connected diagonally. *- if they connected digonally. it announces winner position.
reverse board().

𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑(). *-this function is used to reverse the board why we are reverse to
  *- simply in python the numpy or list print like this:-
      *- 0
      *- 1
      *- 2 in this format.
  *- but when we reverse the board it prints:-
      *- 2
      *- 1
      *- 0
      *- like this it is easy to move pieces and understanding the position of piece.
main function:-

in this function the whole class is runs.
check moving position.
check also who to move their piece.
its also check. which player win the game.
note:- the whole code in coditation assessment.py.
 - once check this file.
 - run on commandprompt.
Conclusion:-
once run commandprontprompt
choose player1 colour.
its display board.
after completion of some sucessful move. to see the winner.
